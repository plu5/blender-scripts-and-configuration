* blender-scripts-and-configuration
** Description
This repository includes my blender interface theme, keyconfig, and scripts Iâ€™ve made.

** Usage
I have mirrored the directory hierarchy under ~<config-folder>/scripts~, so you could either:
- Place each thing in the equivalent directory in your hierarchy, or
- set the extra ~Scripts~ path in User Preferences > File to where you have downloaded / cloned blender-scripts-and-configuration, save user settings and restart.

To then enable each thing:
- Theme :: User Preferences > Theme > Presets dropdown
- Keyconfig :: User Preferences > Input > Presets dropdown
- Addons :: each have to be manually enabled in User Preferences > Add-ons.

# todo: keyconfig documentation
# maybe this should be in the readme in the directory where it is?

*** ~ui_p-layout-search.py~
I have previously made a repository for it [[https://github.com/plu5/p-layout-search][here]]. It adds a search popup for switching between layouts.
**** Usage
Bind ~wm.layout_search~, preferably under Screen > Screen (Global)
*** ~p-script_console_output.py~
Run script from text editor and displays the output in console present in the layout. Some of the logic was taken from CoDEmanX addon [[https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?312821-Run-Script-in-PyConsole-(Menu)][Run Script in PyConsole]], which does something similar except from the console.
**** Usage
Bind ~text.script_console_output~, preferrably under Text > Text Generic
*** ~ui_p-editor-switch-buffer.py~
Search popup for switching between open files in the text editor.
**** Usage
Bind ~wm.editor_switch_buffer~, preferably under Text > Text Generic
